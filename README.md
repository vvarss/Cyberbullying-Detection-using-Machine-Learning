# 💻Cyberbullying-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project contains the detection of cyberbullying using Machine Learning, on twitter texts. 
## ◻️Project Description
This project builds a Machine Learning model to detect cyberbullying in tweets using TF-IDF vectorization and classification algorithms. The model identifies various categories of cyberbullying such as age, gender, religion, ethnicity, and profanity-based harassment.

## 🚀Features
* Preprocessing of tweet text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, spacing normalization)
* TF-IDF vectorization using TfidfVectorizer
* Multi-class classification model for different bullying types
* Ability to predict cyberbullying from any new input text
* Dataset exploration and visualization

## 🔻Project Overview
It uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and classification algorithms to categorize tweets as:
* Age-based bullying
* Ethnicity-based bullying
* Gender-based bullying
* Religion-based bullying
* Other cyberbullying
* Not cyberbullying

The model is trained using a labelled dataset and deployed for real-time predictions on custom text inputs.

## 🪜Workflow
* Load Dataset
* Text Cleaning - To remove space
* TF-IDF Vectorization
* Model Training
* Real time prediction

## 🧩Execution
